# Minecraft Database CLI
Minecraft data query program for commands, NBT, blockstates, and more. Inspired by the in-game help command and auto-completion, with added features like multiple version support and expandable regex search.

This project is a **major WIP** that aims to incorporate [mccq](https://github.com/Arcensoth/mccq) in addition to other types of game data.
